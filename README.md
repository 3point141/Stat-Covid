# Stat-Covid

We all are going through a tough time. The outbreak of Covid-19 has affected us in every possible way. Countless innocent lives are lost and the economy continues to fall. Hopefully there will be a vaccine for it soon. By then, prevention is the best cure. Stay Home and stay awared about the surroundings. <br><br>
As a part of spreading awareness, I wanted to contribute a tiny bit hence this project.
This project aims at providing a chrome extension which helps you keep track of Covid-19 statistics at all time. You do not need to navigate to a traker website to see the info. Saves time.

## Working Demo
<img src="demo.gif" width="50%" height="100%" />

## Features 
```
1. At the start, it takes the client IP and maps to the state where the patient is. 
   So you need not search for your state. Just a click and you have it.
   
2. You can see the stats for all the states in India by just one click.

3. You have a nice search bar where you can type in the name of the state you are interested in 
   and it filters out the records for you.
   
4. You can definetly search for custom states. As you type, the suggestions pop-ups to help you.
```

## How to run as a Chrome Extension?
The "dist" folder is uploaded for this same purpose.
```
1. git clone https://github.com/3point141/Stat-Covid.git
2. Open chrome -> Settings -> More Tools -> Extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click on Load Unpacked
5. Select the dist/Corona folder and you are good to go
```

## Future Works
```
1. Provide more robust filters.
2. Integrate trending twitter tweets for corona virus.
```

## Contribute
I'd love to see new PR from you all. Let's make something beautiful out of it.
