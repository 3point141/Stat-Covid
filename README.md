# Stat-Covid

We all are going through a tough time. The outbreak of Covid-19 has affected us in every possible way. Countless innocent lives are lost and the economy continues to fall. Hopefully there will be a vaccine for it soon. By then, prevention is the best cure. Stay Home and stay awared about the surroundings. <br><br>
As a part of spreading awareness, I wanted to contribute a tiny bit hence this project.
This project aims at providing a chrome extension which helps you keep track of Covid-19 statistics at all time. You do not need to navigate to a traker website to see the info. Saves time.

## How to run as a Chrome Extension?
The "dist" folder is uploaded for this same purpose.
```
1. git clone https://github.com/3point141/Stat-Covid.git
2. Open chrome -> Settings -> More Tools -> Extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click on Load Unpacked
5. Select the dist/Corona folder and you are good to go
```

## Contribute
I'd love to see new PR from you all. Let's make something beautiful out of it.
